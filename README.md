# Description
This pack was created to recreate the gameframe of late 2006, when hunter was released. With the limitations of resource packs currently, it's not possible to have the same exact appearance as the original for resizable mode. I spent a lot of time searching old references and trying to fit the old interface style with the current so it looks as close to the original style as possible.

**This pack is made for both resizable and fixed mode, see below on how to set up fixed mode to work properly.**

## Resizable chatbox
If you prefer to have the chat and stones behind the buttons underneath transparent like the example above, navigate to the `chatbox` folder and open the `Alternative` folder. Drag and drop `background.png` and `buttons_background_stones.png` into the `chatbox` folder to replace the default ones.

Disable and re-enable the resource packs plugin, and if you've done it correctly your chatbox in-game should have changed.

**If you replace these files, fixed mode will not work correctly, use the hub option for default chatbox if you'd like.**

**In order to correctly use in fixed mode theres a couple steps required:**
1. Go to Runelite's plugins and enable "Interface Styles", open the settings and set 'gameframe' to 2006.

2. Go to the Resource packs plugin settings and tick the experimental setting at the bottom 'Don't change Interface Styles'.

3. Disable and Reenable the Resource packs plugin, and you're done.

**If you want to use other packs in fixed mode, you have to make sure to disable the plugin 'Interface Styles' and disable/reenable resource packs for them to work correctly, unless the creators' specify otherwise.**


## Correct icon alignment for Fixed Mode

If you plan on using fixed mode **only**, Navigate to the `tab` folder inside of the resource pack.

Open the `Alternatives` folder, drag and drop all the icons into the `tab` folder to replace the default ones. 

Disable and reenable the resource packs plugin, and if you've done it correctly your tab icons in-game should be correctly aligned.
